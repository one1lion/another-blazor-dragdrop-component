# another-blazor-dragdrop-component
An approach to a reusable component for a Drag-and-Drop user interface.

# Introduction
This project is for a Microsoft .NET Blazor Component Library that will provide an easy way to add a drag and drop feature to a Blazor project.  If you are interested in more information or about how the development process is going so far, take a look at the detailed [introduction on the Wiki](https://github.com/one1lion/another-blazor-dragdrop-component/wiki).  There is a link to the journal-style notes I have been making throughout the development process.  They are more for myself, but also for anyone interested in seeing it.

# Current Status
As of ... around Jan 15, 2020, the development for this project is on hold.  I have spent a fair amount of time building this up to suit the needs of an existing application that I am working on for the company I work for.  If the requirements were for a drag and drop control that allows for re-ordering and dragging between groups, I would only have to clean up the components as they are.  Unfortunately, because I have the desire to allow for nesting drag and drop lists, I added just enough complexity that is making this pretty challenging.  Therefore, I am going to return (have returned) to the application and use the things I have learned from making this component with the progress I have made there.  

This is not permanent.  I will return to this after I have implemented the specific use-case version of the drag and drop component and hopefully be able to make it generic enough that it can be a reusable component soon.  Stay tuned.
